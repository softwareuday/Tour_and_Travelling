                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The construction of Charminar was initiated by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, in 1591. 
                    It was built to commemorate the end of a plague epidemic that had ravaged the city. The name "Charminar" 
                    literally means "four towers," referring to the four minarets that adorn the structure. The mosque was also built as a symbol 
                    of the ruler's devotion to Islam. Over the centuries, Charminar has witnessed the rise and fall of various empires and 
                    has played a significant role in the history of Hyderabad. Today, it stands as a symbol of the city's heritage and a testament
                     to its architectural grandeur.</p>
